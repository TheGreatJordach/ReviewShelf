In a newly created `CHANGELOG.md`, it's common to start with a brief overview and an initial entry for the current version, summarizing the main features, initial setup, or structure of the project at this stage. Here's a suggested structure for the initial `CHANGELOG.md`:

---

### Additional Notes:
As the project progresses, you can add entries under the `Added`, `Fixed`, `Changed`, `Removed`, and `Security` sections for each version. For example:

- **Added**: New features, libraries, or components.
- **Fixed**: Bugs or issues that have been resolved.
- **Changed**: Modified functionality or structure of existing features.
- **Removed**: Features or components that have been removed from the codebase.
- **Security**: Any important security fixes or updates.

This structure helps team members and future collaborators understand the projectâ€™s history and key milestones at a glance.
