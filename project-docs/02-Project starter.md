# Project starter

Great! You've outlined some solid decisions for the **ReviewShelf** app. Based on what we’ve discussed, let’s move forward with creating a project starter that includes:

### Angular
If you're more comfortable with **Angular**, that's definitely a great choice! Since **Angular** is a full-featured framework, it will give you all the built-in tools you need, such as routing, form management, and state handling. It also has great TypeScript support, which you’re already familiar with.

### Adjusting the Project for Angular
We can reframe the **ReviewShelf** project using **Angular** instead of **React + Next.js**. Here's an adjusted plan:

### 1. **App Structure (Angular Version)**
   - **Frontend** (UI/UX)
     - **Angular** (with **Angular CLI** for project scaffolding)
     - **Tailwind CSS** for styling
     - **RxJS** for managing asynchronous streams
   - **Backend** (API)
     - **NestJS** (REST API)
     - **PostgreSQL** (relational DB for structured data)
     - **JWT Authentication** (for secure user login)
     - **WebSockets (Socket.IO)** for live discussions
     - **RxJS** (used extensively for managing asynchronous streams)

### 2. **User Stories & Features** (Same as before)
#### Onboarding
- **Sign Up / Log In**: Use **JWT** authentication for login.
- **Guest Access**: Users can browse books and reviews without an account but must sign up to perform actions (e.g., adding reviews).

#### Book Discovery
- **Search Bar**: With multiple filters.
- **Book Detail Page**: Related books section (optional).

#### Review Engagement
- **Upvoting Reviews**: Users can upvote reviews.
- **Rewards for Highly Rated Reviews**: Visibility boosts or badges.
- **Private Bookshelves**: Track books.

#### Social Features
- **Live Book Discussions**: Use **Socket.IO** for real-time interactions.

### 3. **Tech Stack & Implementation Plan (Angular)**
Here’s how we can implement this:

#### Frontend (Angular)
1. **Angular Setup**:
   - Install Angular and set up the project:
     ```bash
     ng new review-shelf --style=scss
     cd review-shelf
     ```
   - Install **Tailwind CSS**:
     ```bash
     npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
     npx tailwindcss init
     ```
   - Set up **Tailwind** by editing `tailwind.config.js` and `src/styles.scss`.

2. **Authentication (JWT)**:
   - Set up JWT-based login with **Angular's HTTP client**. Use **Guards** to protect routes that require authentication (like review posting).

3. **Search Bar & Filters**:
   - Implement a **search bar** component.
   - Use **Reactive Forms** for the filter options (rating, genre, etc.).

4. **Review Engagement**:
   - Create components for displaying reviews and upvoting.
   - Use **RxJS** streams to handle real-time updates or changes in reviews.

5. **Private Bookshelves**:
   - Use a **BookshelfService** to manage the user's bookshelf (add/remove books, etc.).

#### Backend (NestJS)
1. **NestJS API**:
   - Install NestJS:
     ```bash
     npm install -g @nestjs/cli
     nest new review-shelf-api
     ```
   - Set up **PostgreSQL** with **TypeORM** and create entities like `User`, `Book`, `Review`, `Bookshelf`.

2. **JWT Authentication**:
   - Use **Passport** with **JWT** for user login and token management.

3. **WebSockets for Live Discussions**:
   - Use **Socket.IO** in the backend for live book discussions.
   - Integrate **WebSockets** into the Angular frontend to handle real-time communication.

#### Database Design
1. **User**:
   - id (PK)
   - email, password, role (e.g., reviewer, admin)
   - createdAt, updatedAt

2. **Book**:
   - id (PK)
   - title, author, genre, rating
   - createdAt, updatedAt

3. **Review**:
   - id (PK)
   - userId (FK), bookId (FK)
   - rating, text
   - createdAt

4. **Bookshelf**:
   - id (PK)
   - userId (FK)
   - books (many-to-many with Book)
   - createdAt

---

### 4. **Next Steps in Angular**
1. **Angular Project Setup**: Set up the **ReviewShelf** Angular project with Tailwind CSS and the necessary components (search bar, review list, etc.).
2. **JWT Authentication**: Implement login/signup functionality with JWT.
3. **API Integration**: Connect the frontend to the **NestJS API** to fetch books, reviews, and manage user authentication.
4. **WebSocket Integration**: Implement live book discussions using **Socket.IO** on both the backend and frontend.

This approach should be straightforward given your familiarity with **Angular**, and it still covers all the essential features for the **ReviewShelf** app.
